Anki add-on to query words using Wiktionary data taken from https://kaikki.org

## Usage

The add-on provides an interface to fill notes with defintions, example sentences, etc.
The interface can either be accessed from a button in the editor, or via the **Edit > Bulk-define from Wiktionary** menu
item in the browser for bulk operations on selected notes. You can also configure shortcuts from **Tools > Add-ons**.

You have to download the dictionary data you want for the add-on to work.
For that, find your target language in https://kaikki.org/dictionary/ and download the JSON file containing all data listed at the bottom of the language page (which has a name like "kaikki.org-dictionary-Russian.json").
Then in Anki, go to **Tools > Wiktionary -> Import a dictionary** to import the dictionary.
