An add-on to query words using Wiktionary data taken from https://kaikki.org

<b>Usage</b>
The add-on provides an interface to fill notes with defintions, example sentences, etc.
The interface can either be accessed from a button in the editor, or via the <i>Edit > Bulk-define from Wiktionary</i> menu item in the browser for bulk operations on selected notes. You can also configure shortcuts from <i>Tools > Add-ons</i>.

You have to download the dictionary data you want for the add-on to work. For that, find your target language in https://kaikki.org/dictionary/ and download the JSON file containing all data listed at the bottom of the language page (which has a name like <b>kaikki.org-dictionary-Russian.json</b>). Then in Anki, go to <i>Tools > Wiktionary -> Import a dictionary</i> to import the dictionary.
