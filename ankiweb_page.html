You have to download the dictionary data you want for the add-on to work.
For that, find your target language in https://kaikki.org/dictionary/ and download the JSON file containing all data listed at the bottom of the language page (which has a name like <b>kaikki.org-dictionary-Russian.json</b>).
Then in Anki, go to <b>Tools > Wiktionary -> Import a dictionary</b> to import the dictionary.
